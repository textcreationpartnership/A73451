            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And laſtly, to giue Bell ſure and certaine intelligence, that it was contempt of him, and his bookes, that made them paſſe ſo longe without anſwear, and not any rare learning, or stinginge ſtuffe, as in the light of his darke dreaming conceipt, proceeding from much vanity and litle humility, ſmall grace &amp; great pride, he framed to himſelf.</hi>

The firſt concerning my ſelf: the ſecond touchinge the Miniſter. As for my ſelf, thou shalt vnderſtand (good Reader) that I was once determined, to haue anſweared the treatiſe fully and wholy, as thou maist perceiue by the first and ſecond chapters: but afterward infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of body hindering the courſe of my ſtudies, and deſire of minde to haue it diſpatched with all ſpeed, cauſed an other reſolution which may perhaps reuiue Bels dead ſpirits, and inflame his cooled bloud, and make him com out once againe with his old complaint, that I haue anſweared him by pieces and patches, and for my lugges and guttes durſt not deale with</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Such are Bels phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> 
               <hi>the whole, and that I haue after much labour and ſtudy, much ſiftinge and ſearching, out of the whole tome of his</hi> Triall, <hi>conſiſting almost of fiue and twenty leaues in quarto, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red only eight and fifty vntruthes, and not paſt ſome fiue or ſixe contradictions. If the winde be gotte againe into that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, no remedy but I muſt beare of his storme with the cloake of patience, hopinge that the good reader will conſider, how as I was not bound to meddle with his Pamphlet at all, ſo it was alſo at my choice to leaue what I liſted and take what I pleaſed, eſpecially making open profeſsion of this my courſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken therein, and haue not any way abuſed the good Reader, as Bell hath, who in his</hi> Funeral <hi>doth make the world beleue, that he hath wholy anſweared my</hi> Forerunner, <hi>conſiſting only of fower sheetes of paper, and yet omitteth many notable and principall points, as I noted in the</hi> Dolefull knell <hi>as for</hi>

VVhich that he may doe, I shall not forgett to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend him to his mercy, who deſireth not the death of a ſinner, but that all should com to the knowledg of his name.

And for my part ſory I am, that Bell hath ſo far giuen the raynes to his paſsion, as with ſuch virulent termes, and inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable inſolency, to caſt forth his gantlet of defiance, and to inſult againſt the whole Church of God, which hath made my ſtile before in the Preface, more stirring and quicke, then otherwiſe I would or thought conuenient, least we might be condemned of cowardize or ſeare, (to the preiudice of truth) which ſo often, and ſo opprobriouſly he obiecteth againſt vs.</hi>

                     <hi>remayned a virgin free from all hereſies and corruptions during the liſe of the Apoſtles, that is to ſay, about one hundred yeares after Chriſt, to which time S. Iohn the Euangelist was liuinge. But after the death of the Apoſtles ſayth he, errors by litle and litle crept into the church, as into a voyd and deſert houſe. This aſſertion is dolefull ynoughe and yet very profitable againſt all Popiſh Recuſants of our time, as who are not ashamed impudently to auouch, that after ſo many hundred yeares from Chriſtes aſcenſion, there hath bene no error at all, in their Romish Babilon.</hi> This collection will proue dolefull ynough to him ſelfe, and not very profitable to the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by that time we haue ſifted his words, and examined the authoritye alleadged, for it is powdreed with lies, and iugling tricks, thicke and three-ſould. For firſt if he meaneth any ſuch error, as may ſtand with the integritie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, moſt falſe it is, that we deny any ſuch error may creepe into the Church: for we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly confeſſe that <hi>Papias, S.

Ciprian,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers others with him, were carryed a way in to the error of rebaptization: but yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge theſe their errors, they were true members of the Catholicke church, ſeing that in queſtions newly ſpringing vp, error may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred but not allwayes hereſy, which importeth not only an error in the vnderſtandinge, but alſo malice and obſtinacie in the will, by contemninge the Church her decree and determination. But
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:132780:22"/> if by error, he meaneth hereſie, as no queſtion he doth, both becauſe he ſaith, that <hi>during the liues of the Apostles the Church was free from all hereſies and corruptios, but after their death, error by litle and litle crept in,</hi> and alſo for that he termeth our Church <hi>Romish Babilon</hi> or as he ſpeaketh in his Suruey (where he handleth the very ſame matter) <hi>whorish Babylon;</hi> by which <note place="margin">Page 342.</note> wordes it is plaine, that he meaneth hereticall errors, for ſuch only maketh our Church <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to forſake her true ſpouſe Chriſt, and to comit ſpirituall fornication by cleauing to newe, damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and hereticall opinions: and laſtly for that otherwiſe he proueth nothing againſt vs, the ſcope of his booke being to ſhewe, that our religion is not old, but newe, as being far different from the pure faith of the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>This then being his meaning, moſt falſe it is I ſay that any ſuch errors crept into the Church (I meane with the corruption of the Churches ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere doctrine, though I willingly graunt that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of the Church, haue by hereſie falne from true doctrine, as namely the miniſter him ſelfe) eyther in the Apoſtles time, or ſhall doe vntill the worldes end, and that by the ſingular prouidence of Chriſt, who promiſed <hi>that hell gates should not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle</hi>

                     <hi>againſt his Church,</hi> and many like places to that purpoſe might be alledged. But what ſay we to the authoritye of <hi>Egeſippus</hi> who liued ſtraight after the Apoſtles, cited by Bell for iuſtification of that he affirmed? Nothing els, but that he belieth both <hi>Egeſippus</hi> and alſo <hi>Euſebius,</hi> whome he quoteth in the third booke of his hiſtory cap. 32. as the relator of thoſe wordes of <hi>Egeſippus.</hi> Reade the

                  <p>Neyther can this dealing of his, proceede from other roote then meere malice: for immediatly after this ſentence cited out of <hi>Euſebius</hi> in the 32. chapter of his third booke, he produceth out of the 33. chapter of the ſame booke how <hi>Papias</hi> and <hi>Ireneus</hi> were infected with the error of the <hi>Chiliaſtes,</hi> and that very truly, which ſheweth that he peruſed the place.

Can this procedinge of his ſtewe from any other ſinke then the filthy puddle of his owne corrupt conſcience.

He ſlandreth that great learned man and profeſſor of diuinity, when he woulde make him of his owne opinion: what he thought of the Churches infallibility in not erring, he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth in theſe concluſions. <hi>The firſt.

                     <hi>oſ the Church can not faile. The ſecond concluſion. The Church can not err in beleeuing. The third concluſion. Not only the old Church could not err in fayth, but neyther the church which now is, and which shall be to the end of the world, eyther can or shall err in fayth.</hi> And yet the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter produceth him as I ſayd, to proue that he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies crept into the church, after the time of the Apoſtles: how truly let the reader iudge. The queſtion then wherof <hi>Canus</hi> ſpeaketh, concerneth not any poynt of faith; as in expreſſe termes he there affirmeth, but a matter debatable in ſcholes. True it is that Bell maketh him to ſay that he doth oppoſe him ſelfe againſt all the Thomiſts and Scotiſts, both the old and latter Papiſtes: but the worde (Papiſtes) is foiſted in by him ſelfe, by which he would haue the reader to thinck that he ſpake of auncient fathers, when as he talketh only of old and new Scholemen, as he might learne out of the very title of that chapter, which is <hi>Of the authoritye of the Schole Doctors.</hi> The like may be ſayd of <hi>Caietanus, Nauarrus,</hi> and <hi>Roffenſis,</hi> alledged for the ſame purpoſe by Bell: all which

                     <hi>Chalcedon</hi> to Pope <hi>Leo.</hi> To this may be added, that ſeing (Pope) ſignifieth (father) as Bell according to the truth confeſſeth, it followeth that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe of <hi>Rome</hi> was in old time reputed ſuperiour to all, in that he was called the Father of fathers: for <hi>Steuene</hi> Biſhoppe of <hi>Carthage,</hi> writinge to Pope <hi>Damaſus</hi> in the name of three Councells, celebrated in <hi>Affricke</hi> giueth him this title. <hi>To Pope Damaſus our</hi>

Should a Parlament in England make ten ſeuerall acts, nine very good and beneficiall to the realme, but one cleane oppoſite to former acts, and preiudiciall to the ſoueraigne dignitye of his Maieſtie, wherevppon he confirmed the nine, but the tenth he did vtterly irritate and make voyde; would Bell call that an act of Parlament, or could he with out an vntruth ſo terme it in true and good meaninge? moſt certayne he could not: what followeth I leaue to Bels collecting vaine. But it may be he will ſay, that the confirmation of the Councell belonged not to the Pope. It is not poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he dare offer it: will he make Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſo auncient for time, ſo renoumed for vertue, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for learning, ſuch a ſimple or arrogant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to ſend his legats to be Preſidents of the Councell in his place, to write vnto the Empreſſe, how he did make fruſtrate that decree, yf his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye had not bene certayne in that behalfe, and ſo made him ſelfe a laughing ſtocke to the Empire, and the whole world: and would the Councell haue admitted of his legates, or euer haue made ſuite to him for the confirmation of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, as they did, when they wrote to him in this manner. <hi>And we beſeech thee</hi> (ſay they) <hi>honour our iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:132780:31"/> in defence of that outragious ambition:</p>
                  <p>Here alſo the good reader hath to note, that as the miniſter doth make that the decree of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, which as hath bene ſayd was non at all, ſo doth he make bold with truth beſide a tricke of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption: for no where doe I read in the actes of that Councell that it gaue equall authoritye to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in all eccleſiaſticall affaires, as Bell affirmeth: that worde (all) is foiſted in by the malice of his miniſterſhip, neyther haue they the word (authoritye) but (priuiledges) which conſiſted, for as much as I can learne out of thoſe Actes, in theſe two pointes. The firſt was, that the Metropolitanes of the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes of <hi>Pontus, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> ſhould only be conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated and ordained by the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as alſo ſuch Biſhops as liued in the ſame place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt barbarous people. The ſecond was, that <hi>Conſtatinople</hi> might haue the ſecond place in dignity next after <hi>Rome.</hi> Theſe I ſay were the priuiledges which <hi>Anatolius</hi> deſired ſhould be confirmed by the Pope: for to thinke that he deſired to haue euery wayes ſuperiority, and as Bell writeth, equall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritye in all eccleſiaſticall affaires with <hi>Rome</hi> is contrary to all reaſon, and not agreable to the reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted words out of the Actes, for though <hi>Anatolius</hi> with others decreed that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſhould haue equall priuiledges, yea in eccleſiaſticall matters, yet is that ſtraight limited to the conſecration of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rropolitanes, and to haue the ſecond place in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye, as before was ſayd and is euident alſo out of the 15. Action can. 28. and out of the 16. Action and laſtly out of their relation to the Pope, in
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:132780:31"/> which they craued his confirmation: for there they mention nothinge of equall priuiledges and aduanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, cauſes, but only ſpeake of conſecratinge the Metropolitanes of <hi>Aſia, Pontus,</hi> and <hi>Thrace,</hi> and of hauing the next place after <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet they affirme that they did there ſignifye vnto him all the force of the Actes: whereof it followeth that other priuiledges or eminencye in eccleſiaſticall dignitye was not then deſired: and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely it were meere madnes to thinke that <hi>Anatolius</hi> would euery way haue had equall authority in all eccleſiaſticall cauſes, as the miniſter affirmeth, ſeing then we muſt graunt that he deſired iuriſdiction in <hi>Italie</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe; nay what were it els but to condemne <hi>Anatolius</hi> of groſſe foolerye in ſuyng for that ſuperextrauagant grace of the Pope to the iniury of his owne See and dignitie.</p>
                  <p>Much more might be ſayd to the ſame purpoſe, but it ſhall not neede, when as the thinge is ſo cleere that our mortall enimies confeſſe it: for the <hi>Magdeburgian</hi> hiſtoriographers, after relation how the Roman Legates with-ſtood the audacious attempt of <hi>Anatolius</hi> and his confederates, write thus. <hi>VVherfore the iudges of the Synod decreed that the</hi>

                  <p>AFter Bell had produced many arguments againſt the Popes ſoueraigne ſuperioritye, he maketh a recapitulation of them all, but ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly, that for their better grace he doth floriſh them ouer with new lyes. To ſtande vpon one, that hath a couple of followers. <hi>Fourthly</hi> (quoth he) <hi>ſeing Polycarpus, S. Polycrates, S. Ireneus, and S. Ciprian, with many Bishops of Europe, Aſia, and Affrica, contemned the Bishop of Rome his decrees and ſuppoſed ſupremacye.</hi> That <hi>S. Polycarpus</hi> contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Popes decrees is moſt falſe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly collected out of his former argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:132780:34"/> in which no mention is made of any decree concerninge the keeping of Eaſter (the matter then in queſtion) as ſhall appeare afterwarde when we come to anſwere that argument, how could he then contemne that which was not extant. See the ſcrupulous conſcience of the miniſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe before he paſſed ouer the matter without the marke of his occupation, he hath here made lewde reſtitution clapping three vntruthes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one in the necke of an other. The firſt is now recited, and to make it the more manifeſt I will adioyne what he writeth of this matter in his Motiues. His wordes be theſe <hi>In like manner</hi> (quoth he) <hi>though with more modesty diſſented Anicetus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">pag. 145.</note> 
                     <hi>an other Bishoppe of Rome, from S. Polycarpe, Bishoppe of Smyrna:</hi> where I deſire the good reader to note his malicious dealinge &amp; his rooted hatred againſt thoſe Popes, whom he confeſſeth to haue bene bleſſed Martyrs. <hi>Anicetus</hi> (quoth he) <hi>diſſented from S. Polycarpe:</hi> and why I beſeech him doth he not rather ſay, that <hi>S. Polycarpe</hi> diſſented from <hi>Anicetus:</hi> I truſt he will not deny but that <hi>S. Anicetus</hi> had the better quarrell, except he liſt to condemne the church of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and the whole Chriſtian world that obſerue Eaſter according to the cuſtome of Rome. Beſides this, is it not moſt certayne that <hi>S. Polycarp</hi> was far inferiour in dignitye to <hi>S. Anicetus,</hi> when as ſo much is euident out of the premiſſes, in which we haue heard how the Patriarche of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> did emulate ſome prerogatiues of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not any of Smyrna. An other tricke of his ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cour alſo ſheweth it ſelfe, when as the one is with him plaine <hi>Anicetus,</hi> the other <hi>S. Polycarpe,</hi> why
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:132780:34"/> I beſeech him, was not bleſſed <hi>Anicetus</hi> alſo a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr as well as <hi>S. Polycarpe?</hi> it can not be denyed: and yet doth this miniſter out of his damnable deuotion to the ſea of <hi>Rome,</hi> entreate him in this diſgratious manner. But ſufficient it is for my purpoſe, that he confeſſethe diſſention betwixt <hi>S. Anicetus,</hi> and <hi>S. Polycarpe</hi> to haue bene with more modeſty (to witt then it was betwixt S. Victor and the Biſhops of <hi>Aſia)</hi> which argueth playnely, that no decree was made by <hi>S. Anicetus,</hi> for then the diſſention could not haue bene conteyned within the limitts of modeſty, yf <hi>Polycarpus</hi> had reſiſted his decree, neyther could he haue bene in better caſe then the Biſhopps of <hi>Aſia</hi> were, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>S. Victors</hi> decree, and ſo the diſſention had bene as immodeſt: which ſeing Bell denyeth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he graunteth, that he hath dealt falſy in accuſing <hi>S. Polycarpe</hi> to haue contemned <hi>S. Anicetus</hi> decree, when as he neuer publiſhed any ſuch, what ſoeuer Bell with lying lippes affirmeth to the contrary. This is the firſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</p>
                  <p>The next is where he ſaith, <hi>S. Polycrates contemned the Bishoppe of Rome his decrees,</hi> for where doth he find him enrold for a Saint? not in the Romane martyrologe, not in <hi>Euſebius</hi> or <hi>S. Hierom.</hi> no nor in the Centuries of Magdeburge where they talke of him. He is a Saint only of Bels canonization, becauſe he reſiſted the Pope, which title if it will procure any ſuch grace, the miniſter him ſelfe is like to proue a great and monſterous Saint, for neuer (I dare ſay) did <hi>Polycrates</hi> carry him ſelfe ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently, and in ſuch vnſpeakable contumelious
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:132780:35"/> manner, as Sir Thomas doth.</p>
                  <p>The third vntruth is, that <hi>S. Ireneus</hi> contemned the Biſhoppe of Rome his decrees, and his ſuppoſed ſupremacie: for what father ſo auncient as he, writeth more clerely for his ſupremacye. Speaking of the Romane church theſe be his words. <hi>To this church by reaſon of the more potent principalitye, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 3. cap. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>that euery church should come, that is thoſe faythfull people which be euery where, in which that tradition which came from the Apostles, hath bene kept of them which be in all partes.</hi> Thus he writeth in defence therof: but that euer he oppugned the Popes decrees, or contemned his ſupremacy is moſt falſly affirmed by Bell, as ſhall appeare when we come to examin his ſecond argument againſt the Popes Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, from whence he would ſeme to haue col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected this: but before I come to that pointe, I muſt here admoniſh the good reader, that whereas Bell deſperatly affirmed that the Biſhoppe of Romes ſuperioritye was not hearde of till ſix hundred yeares after Chriſt, the contrary hath not only bene proued ſufficiently before, out of other authorityes, but alſo out of thoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which he bringeth as moſt clere againſt it, to wittout of the <hi>Chalcedon</hi> and <hi>Nicene</hi> Councels, and alſo out of <hi>S. Ireneus</hi> as in the premiſſes hath bene ſayd: and yet further occaſion will be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to verify the ſame truth out of ſome of thoſe arguments alſo, which come now to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſuch is his great grace in beating downe of Popery, and writing againſt him ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The reſt of his chapter conſiſteth of eight ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments culled together, to ſhew that the Popes
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:132780:35"/> ſupremacy began in the tyme of <hi>Phocas</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, in the yeare of Chriſt 607: which in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I will diſcuſſe. But before I muſt haue a litle craſh with him about the title which is <hi>of the Popes ſuperroiall power,</hi> for the word <hi>(ſuperroiall)</hi> I ſuppoſe ſlylye mocketh at that which venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble antiquity confeſſeth, and him ſelfe muſt not denye.

                     <hi>whatſoeuer: but yf the grace of the chaires differ, yet the glory of the martyrs is one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe authorities ſhew two things: the firſt is, that <hi>S. Peter</hi> was reputed with the auncient fathers, head and prince of the Apoſtles, and alſo that the very Pagans were not ignorant of that thinge, which I ſuppoſe will not greatly content Bell, for certayne deductions that may be drawne from thence. The ſecond (which is the cauſe why I haue alledged this of <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul)</hi> is, that diſlike or reprehenſion of an other mans action, doth not argue the man reproued not to be the others ſuperior, how ſoeuer Bell would inferr that: when as hath bene ſayd, <hi>S. Paul</hi> inferiour to <hi>S. Peter,</hi> reprehended him. And therefor the moſt that can deduced out of the miniſters idle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe is, that if him ſelfe wer a Biſhoppe he would looke as the deuill (God bleſſe vs) is ſayd to haue looked ouer <hi>Lincolne:</hi> and none might without incurring of is mortall indignation admoniſh him of any fault or ſcandalous demeanure. Great pitty ſurely it is, that one qualified as he is, and endowed with ſuch an humble ſpirite, ſhould not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to an Epiſcopale or (to vſe his owne phraſe) ſome ouerſeing dignitye, Thus by diſmol deſtiny, Bels argument hath rather hurt him, then giuen him any help at all.</p>
                  <p>But one neceſſary adiunct belonged to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, which he thought good not to touch, for ſcalding of his fingers, to witt that <hi>S. Victor</hi> excommunicated the Biſhopps of <hi>Aſia</hi> as I noted before: for ſeing Bell confeſſeth, that the old <note place="margin">In his F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>the ſame doctrine which S. Peter had done afore them:</hi> and moſt certayne that <hi>S. Victor</hi> was one of thoſe holy Martyrs, it followeth that he vſurped no authority, but exerciſed that which lawfully he might, neyther that he taught any doctrine, but that which <hi>S. Peter</hi> had done before him: Out of which and the precedent diſcourſe three or foure memorable notes may be inferred againſt Bell. The firſt and principall is, that the Primacye of the Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> began not ſix hundred yeares after Chriſt, as befor he mayntayned, hauing bene practiſed four hundred yeares before by <hi>S. Victor,</hi> and deſcended to him from <hi>S. Peter.</hi> The ſecond is, that Bels argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt the ſupreame authority of the Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome,</hi> being duly and truly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, proueth the cleane contrary. The third is, that the miniſter cunningly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cealed the cauſe why <hi>S. Ireneus</hi> reproued <hi>S. Victor,</hi> as nothing fitting his purpoſe. The fourth may be, that moſt perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly he inferreth out of the reprehenſion of <hi>S. Ireneus,</hi> that he contemned the Biſhoppe of <hi>Rome</hi> his decrees, and ſuppoſed ſupremacy as before hath bene noted.</p>
                  <p>I add laſtly, that whatſoeuer <hi>S. Ireneus</hi> and others thought, yet bleſſed Pope <hi>Victor</hi> proceded moſt prudently, for as much as he perceiued how that obſeruation (which in the time of <hi>Anicetus</hi> was only variety of rite, without preiudice of religion) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan now to corrupt the ſoundnes of the Catholike fayth, one <hi>Blastus</hi> (who liued in <hi>Victors</hi> time, as <note place="margin">Lib. 5. hiſt. cap. 15.

                  <p>And albeit <hi>S.

                  <p>Out of that which hath bene ſaide, the miniſters firſt doubt is ſolued, why the Pope rather alleadged the decrees of the Nicene Councel, then any other prooffe out of the Goſpell, becauſe as I ſaid the queſtion was not about his ſupremacy in generall, as Bell cuningly or malitiouſly maketh it, but of Appeales, which though it be a thinge conſectary to his ſupreame iuriſdiction, yet for the reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, ſom doubt might be made about the exerciſe thereof: for the ſatisfying of which, no better reſolution coulde be deuiſed then of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councell. The good reader alſo can not but ſufficiently gather out of the premiſes, an anſwere to the ſecond queſtion, to witt, that neither Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus the Pope, nor any of his predeceſſors forged any canons, as Bell and ſuch like with lying lippes affirme, (who meaſure others according to them ſelues) both for that, they appealed to <hi>Rome,</hi> out of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:132780:43"/> Affrike, before the tyme of the Nicene councell, and ſo litle needed they (had they bene ſo wicked) to forge any thinge to proue that which was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed before: and for that ſtraight after appeales were likewiſe admitted, and alſo for that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> had his Legate there reſident a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, for the diſpatch of eccleſiaſticall buſines, as out of Pope Leo hath bene declared. The ſame thinge alſo appeareth, in that neither the Affricane Biſhops nor <hi>S. Austen</hi> euer obiected any ſuch crime of forgery to any of thoſe Popes, as the miniſteriall fraternity of forgers doe, but contrariwiſe behaued them ſelues in moſt dutifull manner, giuing them very reuerent &amp; honourable titles, proteſtinge alſo their obedience and ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to them as hath bene ſaide: and ſo they be far vnlike to our Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t profeſſours, that perſecute them with ſcrrilous and odius termes. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the vnſeemely carriage, and bitter accuſation of our Goſpellers doth manifeſtly argue their ſpighte to theſe Popes, and that they condemne them as guilty of forgery, ſo their dutifull and obedient deportment towardes thoſe holy Popes, giue the worlde to vnderſtande that they were far from any ſuch malitious conceipt: and therefore albeit I might content my ſelfe with that which hath bene ſaide, yet more to cleare them from the venim of Bels aſpiſh lippes, and to free them wholy from the malitious imputation of the miniſter, and that in the iudgement of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different reader.</p>
                  <p>I ſay further that theſe canons of the Nicen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Albeit that which hath bene ſaide, may giue full ſatisfaction to any man of moderation yet more to muſle the mouth of the miniſter, I adde and ſay, that theſe canons of appeale being founde formally in the Councell of <hi>Sardica,</hi> where in moſt ample and playn words, both in the fourth &amp; ſeuenth ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, <note place="margin">Can. 4. &amp; 7.</note> appellations to <hi>Rome</hi> are ratified and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: both Pope <hi>Sozimus</hi> and others, call them by the name of the Nicene canons, though they be founde in the Councell of <hi>Sardica:</hi> and the reaſon is, for that theſe two Councels are accounted for all one: both becauſe the ſame fathers that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at <hi>Nice,</hi> were alſo a great number of them at <hi>Sardica,</hi> and alſo for that no newe thinge touching faith was there enacted: whereas in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, newe hereſies were condemned: and this is the cauſe, why it maketh not any number, for being a generall and approued Councell, it ſhould be the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in order, being celebrated an eleauene yeares after the death of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, as the <hi>Magdeburgians</hi> them ſelues relate out of <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>

                  <p>THe miniſter pleading here hard for the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Prieſts, hath theſe wordes. <hi>For this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect did holy Paphnutius ſtande vp in the Councell of Nice, at ſuch times as the Fathers then and there aſſembled together, thought to haue ſeuered married Prieſts and Bishops from their wiues, and tolde them according to gods worde, that to forbidde marriage to Priests, was too ſeuere a lawe: He yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this reaſon, becauſe marriage is ſo honourable in all ſorts of men. Thus writeth Caſsiodorus, thus writeth Socrates, thus writeth Sozomenus.</hi> And thus lieth the miniſter, for none of theſe there ſpeake any one worde that Paphnutius ſhoulde tell them, that according to Gods worde to forbid marriage to Prieſts was too ſeuere a lawe: he ſpeaketh not one ſyllable of ſuch as were Prieſts already, as though he woulde haue them permitted to marry as Bell falſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth in the fore alledged words, and more plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nely in the page following, where he ſaith that <hi>Paphnutius motion was approued of the whole Councell and therevpon the matter was left as indifferent for euery Priest either to marry or not to marry at his owne choice.</hi> Falſe I ſay it is, that either <hi>Caſsiodorus, Socrates,</hi> or <hi>Sozomenus</hi> ſpeake any one worde of the marriage of Prieſts, or haue any ſuch thinge that the matter was left
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:132780:45"/> indifferent for euery Prieſt to marry or not to marry at his owne choyce. Why did he not quote the places where his reader might haue tried the truth of his relation? what meaneth this flying of the light? what els, but that he had rather haue his bare worde taken, then the matter examined. It will not ſorue his turne, that in the ende of his Chapter, he referreth the reader to his Suruay, where thoſe places be cited: for that booke is not alwayes at hand, and beſide no ſuch ſpeciall place is there named, that without difficulty what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired can not be founde. But view the places who pleaſe, and the fidelity and ſincere conſcience of the miniſter will ſoone appeare, for as much as the contrary of that Bell affirmeth, remayneth there vpon recorde.</p>
                  <p>Caſsiodorus the author of the tripartite hiſtory in the place quoted By Bell, citeth <hi>Sozomenus,</hi> from whom he receiueth that which he there reporteth which is this, ſpeaking of the Nicene Councell, <hi>that it did ſeeme good to ſome to bring in a lawe that Bishoppes, and Priests, Deacons, and Subdeacons, shoulde not ſleepe with their wiues, which they had married before conſecration. But Paphnutius the confeſſor riſing yp in the midſt, withſtode it, conſeſsing marriage to be honourable, and ſayinge that the comapny of a mans owne wife was chaſtity, and he aduiſed the Councell not to make any ſuch lawe, affirminge that it was a greate cauſe, which might be to them or their wiues, the occaſion of fornication.</hi> This doth he alleadge out of <hi>Sozomenus,</hi> leauing yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out which that author hath, the cauſe as I ſuppoſe (yf any place be left for coniecture)
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:132780:46"/> why Bell rather quoted <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> then <hi>Sozomenus.</hi> For <hi>Sozomenus</hi> addeth alſo theſe words of <hi>Paphnutius</hi> immediatly following. <hi>And that the old tradition of the church was, that thoſe which were made Prieſts being not yet married, should not afterwarde marry wiues: but they which were called to that order being married, shoulde not be ſeparated from their wiues which they had.</hi> The very ſame thinge hath <hi>Socrates.</hi> By which the good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may iudge what a conſcience the miniſter hath, when he bluſheth not to ſay, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell left it indifferent for euery Prieſt to marry or not to marry at his owne choyce, when as there is no one worde ſpoken of thoſe that married after taking of holy orders, but only of thoſe that were ordered after they were married, as both <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> out of <hi>Sozomenus,</hi> and <hi>Sozomenus</hi> him ſelfe together with <hi>Socrates</hi> ioyntly aſfirme: nay when as <hi>Sozome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> both ſay, that the olde tradition of the Church was, that thoſe which tooke holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders vnmarried, might not marry at all. This being ſo, who will deny that the miniſter had not great reaſon, neither to cite their wordes, nor quote their places, fathering ſo groſſe an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth vpon them.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, yet at leaſt it appeareth out of the former authors, that thoſe which were married folke, and afterwarde became Prieſts, might ſtill vſe the company of their wiues, which is agaynſt the practiſe of the Romayne Church. To this I ſay firſt, that our queſtion is not now about that pointe, but whether Bell hath not ſlaundered theſe authors, when he maketh them to ſay that thinge, which they ſay not, but haue the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:132780:46"/> cleane contrary. Secondly notwithſtanding I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that this may ſeme to make for the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of the Grecians, who retayne ſtill thoſe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, which they had married before entring into holy orders: but it helpeth nothinge at all our late Apoſtates, that after their conſecration and vowe of chaſtity, without all ſcruple, nay yf we liſt to belieue them, with the teſtimony of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, prouided them ſelues of younge yoake fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, for the comfort of their declining yeares, and ſpirituall begetting the liberty of the newe goſpell: yet in truth doth it neither releue the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of the Grecians: for ſo much as neither any ſuch thinge is extant in the Nicene Councell, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant proffes to ſhewe that no ſuch thing was euer there decreed: for <hi>Sozomenus</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> being knowne heretiks, deſerue no credit, eſpecially the firſt of them, being noted by bleſſed <hi>S. Gregory</hi> for <note place="margin">Lib. 6. ep. 31.</note> one that hath many lyes: and <hi>Socrates</hi> knowne for a man of like quality, as I coulde eaſily ſhewe, were it not that I deſire all conuenient breuity, but principally for that <hi>S. Hierom</hi> and <hi>S. Epiphanius</hi> (who liued more nere to the time of the Nicene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell then the other twayne did) affirme ſo much of the cuſtome of the Eaſtern church as can not ſtande with their former teſtimonies, as ſtraight after ſhall be handled. Wherefore ſeing it muſt nedes be, that either <hi>Sozomenus</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> erre from the truth, or <hi>S. Hierome,</hi> and <hi>S. Epiphanius,</hi> none I thinke of indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, but will preferre Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes before heretikes: and thoſe that liued nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the tyme of the Nicene Councell, then tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe that were farther of: and this is ſo certayne, that

                  <p>NOwe followeth a litter of diuers lyes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned in three or fower lynes, of which I muſt ſpeake in particular. Pleading ſtill for the marriage of the clergie he ſaith. <hi>For this reſpecte was it that many learned and holie bishops were maryed in the auncient tyme, and flourishinge ſtate of the Church, vz S. Gregorie, S. Clement, S. Spiridion. S. Philogonius, S. Eupſichius and others.</hi> This he bringeth to proue, that they marryed after receiuinge of holie orders, or at leaſt vſed ſtill the carnall company of their former wiues, or els he proueth nothinge. But in theſe wordes is conteyned a notorious lye, with
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:132780:50"/> ſiue followers and others. Why hath he not noted in his margent ſufficient authoritie to iuſtify what he ſaith? will theſe tricks of truſtie ſir Thomas neuer be lefte? It ſerueth not the turne to tell vs, that he hath done it in his <hi>Suruey,</hi> and that for two reaſons. The firſt is, becauſe many haue not that booke, and no reaſone can he alleadge for not addinge the quotations here, but onlye that he would haue his ignorant reader, to take all vpon the reporte of his worde; Secondly for that I finde not in all his Suruey any <hi>Clement</hi> noted for a marryed biſhop, and yet haue I viewed ouer the third and fourth chapters of his third parte, where he entreateth of that matter: But to runne ouer his particular catalogue.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>S. Gregorie,</hi> the father of <hi>S. Gregorie Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen.</hi> did marry after he was Biſhopp is one vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth: for he was marryed before euer he was chriſtened, as he may learne out of that funerall Oration of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> which in his Suruey he <note place="margin">Pag. 222.</note> citeth to proue him a marryed bishoppe. That <hi>S. Clement</hi> after the dignitie of biſhopp tooke any wife, is a ſecond vntruth: for I challeng him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, thoughe litle knowinge what <hi>Clement</hi> he meaneth. That <hi>S. Spiridion</hi> was marryed I graunte, but Bell muſt proue, that it was after he was created Biſhopp, and not before, or at leaſte that he vſed the company of his wife which he will neuer doe, and ſo that maketh the third vntruth. The verie ſelfe ſame thinge I ſay of <hi>S. Cheremon,</hi> and <hi>S. Philogonius</hi> which make vpp the fourth and fift vntruthes.</p>

                  <p>OF <hi>Saint Eupſichius</hi> more conſideration is to be had, for Bell not onely here maketh him a marryed biſhoppe, but alſo in his Suruey <note place="margin">Pag. 222.</note> ſaith, that he was <hi>Bishopp of Ceſarea and a marryed man, and ſoone after his marryage martyred for leſus Chriſte.</hi> For if this be true, which ſo confidentlye he affirmeth, it ſeemeth very plaine, that his marryage did followe holie orders. But out vpon the currupt conſcience of this caſta way. I vtterly deny that he was euer Biſhopp, or in any ſacred orders at all, being only a laye man, and of an honorable family. How doth he proue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary? For iuſtification of that he ſaith, he quoteth in the margent the Tripartite hiſtorie, and <hi>Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 6. cap. 14. Lib. 10. cap. 10.</note> The wordes of the tripartite hiſtorie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſe. <hi>Furthermore at that tyme, they ſay that Baſilius a Prieſt of the churche of Ancyra, ended his life by martir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Eupſichius a citizen of Ceſarea in Cappadocia hauing latelie marryed a wife, being yet as it were a brydgroome.</hi> Where is here any mention of his being Biſhoppe. <hi>Sozomenus</hi> from whom <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> (the compiler of the triparaite hiſtorie) tooke thoſe Wordes ſaith, that <hi>Eupſichius</hi> was <hi>ex patricys, of the ſenators or nobilitie,</hi> without any mention of his Epiſcopall dignitie.</p>

                     <hi>Nicephorus</hi> his ſecond authour deliuereth the ſtory in this manner <hi>Hoc ipſo tempore &amp;c.

                     <hi>honorable kinred, who a litle before had marryed a wife. and was as yet a bridegroome.</hi> And this is ſo certaine, that the Lutheran Centuriſts who would as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie heare newes of a biſhopp marryed after his conſecration as Bell, but being heerin not ſo impudent as he (that ſeemeth to be aſhamed of nothing but truth and honeſtie) teporte him onely to haue bene a noble man. <hi>Eupſichius</hi> (ſay they) <hi>was</hi>

                  <p>IN this chapter after he hath diſputed againſt purgatory, with the authority of Roffenſis (of which els where I entend to ſpeake more) he cometh to his recapitulation and ſaith. <hi>Secondly, that the church of Rome beleeued it not</hi> (that is purgatory) <hi>for the ſpace of 250. yeares, after which time, it encreaſed by litle and litle.</hi> This either he meaneth is gathered
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:132780:52"/> out of the teſtimony of <hi>Roffenſis</hi> &amp; that is not true, for nothing doth <hi>Roffenſis</hi> ſpeake of 250. yeares, or deny that Purgatrory was alwaies beleeued in the church, although he confeſſeth that the doctrine thereof was not generally ſo well knowen as now it is, which is farre different from this propoſition: Purgatory was not beleeued of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> for the ſpeace of 250. yeares after Chriſt: Or els he affirmeth of himſelfe, that Purgatory was not beleued vntil that time, which I make no doubt but it is his meaning, for as muche as he teacheth the ſame thinge in other of his bookes: and then I muſt be ſo bould to tell him, that it is alſo a manifeſt vntruth, as I haue proued againſt him in the <hi>Dolefulle knelle,</hi> out of <hi>S. Denis S. Pauls</hi> ſcholler, <note place="margin">Pag. 55. 56.</note> and <hi>Tertullian:</hi> yea and to his vtter confuſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced out of himſelfe: in this place I wille adde the teſtimony of his brother <hi>Perkins.</hi> Who in his Problem confeſſeth, that Purgatory in the church was firſt receiued by <hi>Tertullian</hi> the Montaniſt, <note place="margin">Verbo Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorium. pag. 185.</note> wherein is one open vntruth, to witt that he was the firſt, for he onely affirmeth it, but proueth it not, and no marueil when he can not, ſeing moſt certaine it is, that it came from the Apoſtles. <hi>Non</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hom. 69. ad popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum. Praier for the doade commeth from the Apoſtles.</note> 
                     <hi>temere &amp;c. Not without cauſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>S. Chryſostome) theſe thinges were ordained of the Apoſtles, that in the dreadfull mysteryes, commemoration should be made of the dead: for they knowe that thereby much gaine doth come vnto them, and much profitte.</hi> Much more to the ſame purpoſe, might be produced.</p>
                  <p>An other vntruth he hath, but more ſecretly conueyed vz that the doctrine of purgatory is a braunche of Montaniſme: which is moſte falſe,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:132780:53"/> none euer of antiquity notinge that in <hi>Tertullian</hi> for any erroneous doctrine: which no queſtion they would, had they reputed that of like quality with the other. Bell for that great skille which he hath in auncient monuments, and great dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in diſcouering the origine of Popery, whereof <note place="margin">Suruey epi ſtle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorie.</note> he vaunteth to the ſolace of his ſoule, ſhall do well to iuſtify theſe two pointes of his preciſe brother: or if his leiſure ſerue him not for ſo much, at leaſt let him defend himſelf from lyinge, when as <hi>Tertullian</hi> by the teſtimony of <hi>Perkins</hi> confeſſeth Purgatory, who was dead before the yeare two hundred and fiftye.</p>
                  <p>Here the iudicious reader may alſo note how the miniſter contradicteth himſelf. In his Suruaye intreatinge of Purgatory he ſayeth: <hi>Thus by litle and</hi>

                     <hi>litle, it increaſed, till the late Bishoppes of Rome made it an article of Popishe fayth.</hi> Where in the margent he noteth the time thus: <hi>In the yeare of our Lord 250.</hi> Heere he ſayth, <hi>that the church of Rome beleued it not for the ſpace of 250. yeares; after which</hi> (as he telleth vs) <hi>it encreaſed by litle and litle:</hi> and ſo in this place he maketh the ſeede of Purgatory not to haue been ſowen before the yeare 250, and after ward to haue encreaſed till it came to perfection: there he affirmeth, that the ſeede was ſowen before. and encreaſed by litle and litle vntille it became ripe and perfect Popery, which was in the yeare 250: and ſo Purgatory was ſowen &amp; not ſowen: growen and not growen: an article of fayth, and not an article of faith, in the ſame one yeare 250. I will not deny but the miniſter hath ſom skill in botching together of ould endes of diuinity
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:132780:53"/> gathered out of the ragge markett of <hi>Caluin</hi> &amp; ſuch like Ceneua-merchants: yet I feare me it will be to hard for him, ſo to cobble the ſayings together, that the flawe of a contradiction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not.</p>

                  <p>That learned man diſputinge of the neceſsity of confeſsion to be made to a Prieſt (not mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the word auricular, whatſoeuer Bell ſayeth) <note place="margin">In 4. diſt. 17. quaſt. 1.</note> enquireth by what lawe a man is bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, and determineth firſt in generall, that the precept muſt growe from one of theſe lawes, either from the lawe of nature, or the lawe poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue of God, or the lawe of Churche: and deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to particulars, he reſolueth firſt, that we are not bound by the lawe of nature: nextly he diſputeth whether it groweth from the precept of the Churche, and not liking that opinion, he proceedeth to the next member and ſayth. <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiter &amp;c. To be short, it ſeemeth more reaſonable to hould the ſecond member, that confeſsion falleth vnder the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue precept of God: But then we muſt conſider</hi> (ſayth <hi>Scotus) whether it be found explicitely</hi> (or in expreſſe tearmes) <hi>in the Goſpell immediatly from Chriſt, becauſe it is manifest</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that it is not in the old lawe, or whether it be from him expreſſely in ſome of the Apostles doctrine: or if neither ſo nor ſo, whether then it was giuen of Chriſt by word only, and published to the Church by the Apoſtles:</hi> And hauing made this triple diuiſion, how confefsion might com by the precept of God, that is either firſt commaunded by him in the Ghoſpell: or els ſecondly to be found in ſome of the Apoſtle writings: or laſtly inſtituted of Chriſt by word of mouth only.

                  <p>COncerning his ſeuenth chapter wherein he diſputeth of venial ſinnes, two things are to be noted, before we come to his vntruthes. The firſt is, that all Catholick writers both old and new, acknowledge and confeſſe ſome ſinnes to be venial, and not to deſerue the euerlaſting paine of hell fire, as by and by ſhall more plentifully be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. The ſecond is, that there be two ſmall things (commonly called ſchole queſtions) wherein di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers follow diuers opinions. The firſt is whether venial ſinnes be contrary to the commanundement, or beſide the commaundement: ſom learned men houlding the one opinion, and ſom embracing the other: which is a curious quiddity, diſputable in ſcholes, and nothing touching the hart of religion, and beſides none of theſe, but willingly ſubmitte them ſelues to the cenſure of the catholik Church: and yet the miniſter as though it were ſome fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental point, noteth here very grauely out of <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> that the one opinion is now more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the ſcholes, then the other, and out of that by maine dexterity of learning inferreth the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of our religion: but he ſhould haue done
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:132780:59"/> well to haue proued firſt that this concerned reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that is any point of fayth, as he would haue it thoughte, or els he ſayth nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſchole queſtion though ſomwhat greater is, from whence it cometh, that ſom ſinnes be mortal, ſome venial, whether from the nature of the ſinnes them ſelues, or from the mercy of God. The common opinion, moſt receiued and moſt ſound is, that ſome ſinnes of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be ſmall or venial, others great and mortall. Biſhop <hi>Fisher,</hi> and ſome fower other alleadged by Bell, thincke that all ſinnes of their owne nature be mortal: &amp; that it proceedeth from the mercy of God that ſom be venial, becauſe he would not vpon diuers ſmaller ſynnes impoſe ſo great a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. But not withſtanding this ſmall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, neither <hi>B. Fisher,</hi> nor any of the others deny veniall ſinnes, as Bell and his conſorts doth.</p>
                  <p>This being ſo let vs conſider what a notable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth (and that often rehearſed) the miniſter offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to the viewe of his readers, when he ſayth: <hi>Almainus, Durandus, Gerſon, Baius and other famous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, not able to anſweare the reaſons againſt veniall ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, confeſſe the truth with the Bishop that euery ſinne is mortall.</hi> He doth cunningly abuſe them in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing out thoſe wordes <hi>of it owne nature,</hi> which ought to haue been added according to their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and he like wiſe doth adde in citing of <hi>Roffenſis</hi> immediatly before: doth not this dealing of his argue that he would haue his reader to thincke, that theſe learned men denyed all veniall ſynnes, which damnable doctrine of the Proteſtants they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:132780:59"/> deteſt: for example Biſhop <hi>Fisher</hi> in his 22. article againſt <hi>Luther</hi> houldeth ſom ſynnes to be veniall: (that is ſuch as take not away Gods grace) <hi>Nec opinor te &amp;c.

                  <p>In his motiues he ſetteth downe this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note>

                  <p>Out of theſe words of his I inferre, firſt, that he trippeth when he ſayeth: that their Pope can not erre in matters of faithe iudicially, is this day with the Papiſts an article of their faith, for here he confeſſeth the contrary. I deduce ſecondly, that he groſſely contradicteth himſelf, affirming that in one place which he denieth in an other. I gather thirdly, that he ouer-reached (as I noted before) when he affirmed, that we make none but the Pope iudge of all controuerſies, for generally all Catholicks make a Councell with the Pope alſo the iudge, and ſome as hath nowe been ſaid, in no caſe make the Pope alone the iudge, but iointly with a generall Councell.</p>

                  <p>But ſaith Bell, the Fathers commonly ioyned merits and grace together.

                     <hi>TRue it is likewiſe</hi> (ſaith Bell) <hi>that not only the fathers generally, but the beſt Popishe ſchole doctors alſo, Durandus, Aquinas, Gregorius Ariminenſis, Dominicus Soto, Marſilius, VValdenſis, Burgenſis, and ſundy other, do vniſormly and conſtantly affirme, that no mans workes, how holy ſo euer they be, either are or can be meritorious pro perly, but only meritorious in an improper, and large kinde of ſpeache, as is already ſaide: This is proued at large, in my other bookes.</hi> This indeede is handled in his other bookes: for his ſpeciall grace is, with the ſame matter, to make many newe pamphlets: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be proued or no, is an other queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Should I ſhake vp, &amp; in particular examin theſe authors, many vntruthes would be diſcouered: but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende it not, partly becauſe it would be tedious, partly for that ſome of thoſe authors, be not as hand, and laſtely for that one S. R. in his learned
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:132780:69"/> anſwere to his Challenge of <hi>The downefall</hi> hath canuaſed all theſe authorities, and laied open his fraudulent and lying proceeding. To that booke <note place="margin">Art. 5. chap. 60</note> therfore for ſifting of this ſentence, I refer the reader. Here only I ſay briefly. Firſt that all theſe Catholique writers, and all others do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that good workes are meritorious of eternal life: only ſome of them named by Bell, vary about the manner of ſpeache, for they would not haue the words <hi>condigne</hi> or <hi>congrual</hi> to be vſed: but only that we ſhould ſay, that the workes of iuſte men proceeding from grace be meritorious of eternall life, as <hi>waldenſis,</hi> and <hi>Burgenſis.</hi> Others will haue good workes to be meritorious condignely, that worde being taken in a large manner. So <hi>Durandus</hi> and <hi>Ariminenſis.</hi> Secondly I ſay that neither <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Gregorius Ariminenſis, Dominicus Soto, Marſilius, VValdenſis,</hi> or <hi>Burgenſis,</hi> do allowe that good workes proceeding from grace, are not otherwiſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious, ſaue only for the promiſe of Chriſt, and his free acceptation, as moſte bouldely he affirmeth, and therefore doth he therein ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, when he ſaieth that all the former authors, <hi>doe affirme workes only meritorious in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and large kinde of ſpeache as is already ſaid,</hi> that is according to his precedent doctrine, that they be meritorious only for the promiſe of God, and his free acceptation, and not otherwiſe: this is an vntruth I ſay, ſpeaking thus of them all in general, for one particular inſtance to the contrary ouerthroweth him, yet I will adde a couple. <hi>S. Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſhalbe the firſt, who tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that a man in grace may meritte euerlaſting
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:132780:70"/> life condignely: and he giueth the reaſon, becauſe <hi>euerlaſting life is rewarded according to the iudgement of</hi>

Paul,</hi> and ſo not of mercy only and Gods free acceptation: he confeſſeth alſo as is euident out of the very title of his article, meritte of condignity, which Bell a little before calleth <hi>a monſter lately borne at Rome:</hi> ſo we ſee that <hi>S. Thomas</hi> attributed more to the merit of workes proceding from grace, then pleaſeth his humour, and conſequently that he doth greatly abuſe him, when he would haue him teach no other merit of workes, then by Chriſtes only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and free acceptation.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſhalbe <hi>Dominicus Soto,</hi> cited here alſo by Bell, who aknowledgeth that workes procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from grace, doe merit co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dignely. <hi>The workes of</hi>

                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:132780:87"/> ſuppoſeth to be <hi>Holcotes.</hi> Hauing deliuered theſe two opinions, <hi>betwixt which</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>there is more diſagreement in wordes then in the thinge it ſelf,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed of them both, and the operation of our ſoule, as well in reſpect of that which is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the image, as the image it ſelf, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this manner. <hi>But the question</hi> (quoth he) <hi>is, whether that act or operation by which I an carryed to the image, ought to be called adoration: to which I ſay, that it is called adoration analogically and improperly, &amp; not properly becauſe it is in reſpect of a creature.</hi> In which wordes <hi>Gabriel</hi> houldeth that images may be adored, though not properly, that is with that honour and adoration peculiar only to God, called <hi>Latria:</hi> but with a leſſer kind of adoration, which he calleth <hi>Analogicall</hi> or improper, becauſe it is infinitly infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the former, and due only to the image, for that reſpect and relation, which it hath to that which it doth repreſent. Iudge now (good reader) whether Bell hath not moſt groſſely ſlaundered him, when ſo confidently he auoucheth that he <hi>doth, sharply inuaighe and reproue the worshippe done to images,</hi> when as he is ſo far from reprouing it, that he alloweth it in manner before ſpecifyed.</p>
                  <p>An other thinge here occurreth worth the nothinge, and that is where as Bell hath the ſame matter on foote in the pamphlet of his <hi>woefull crys</hi>

               <p>And here by the way, the attentiue reader may eaſily anſwear a common and friuolous obiection of the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that maruaile how we make the Maſſe the ſacrifice of the new teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ordayned by Chriſt himſelf, when as <hi>Durandus</hi> &amp; others, note at what tyme, and who they were, that compoſed the parts thereof: when as neither <hi>Durandus,</hi> nor any other make the eſſential and very ſubſtantiall part of the maſſe, that is the wordes of conſecratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to haue come from any other then the ſonne of God: but they ſpeake of the accidentall parts thereof, to witt either deuoute prayers, or ceremonies, which we willingly graunt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from the inſtitution of Chriſtes Church.</p>

                     <hi>whom they ſuppoſed to be the God of battaile: the honour they did exhibit vnto her, was this, they went vp and downe the ſtreets with candles and torches burning in their hands: in regard hereof, that the Chriſtian Romans should not be inferiour to the Pagane Romans in heathenishe ſuperſtition Pope Sergius decreed, that vpon the day of the Purification of the bleſſed Virgin, being the ſecond of February, they should goe in proceſsion with burning candles in their hands, thereby ſignifying the bleſſed virgin to be pure and free from ſynne.</hi> For proffe of this, he quoteth <hi>Durandus</hi> in the margent, whom notoriouſly he abuſeth as alſo Pope <hi>Sergius.</hi> For <hi>Durandus</hi> is ſo far from ſaying <note place="margin">Lib. 1. cap. 6.</note> that this was done, that the Chriſtian Romans ſhould not be inferiour to the Pagan Romans in heathenishe ſuperſtition, as Bell writeth, that he affirmeth Pope <hi>Sergius</hi> to haue chaunged that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganicall faſhion <hi>in melius, into a better thinge:</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyinge playnely, that this ceremony was inſtituted for the abolishinge of that heathenishe cuſtome which is a thing ſo far from iuſte reprehenſion, that on the contrary it is moſt highely to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, as a moſt religious pollicy, tending to the diſtruction of ſuperſtition, and encreaſe of piety and deuotion.

               <p>IN this chapter he complayneth, that whereas Bishoppes had free acceſſe to Councels to

R.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Art. 7. chap. 14.</note> in his learned anſwear to that booke of his, where he sheweth that the like oath was made to <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the great. Bell not hauing yet deuiſed with himſelf what to ſay in his owne defence, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the anſwear, though in an other place of his pamphlett he confeſſeth to haue ſeene <hi>S. R.</hi> his <note place="margin">Chap. 9.</note> booke, and ſo he is freshe vp with this oath, as though it had neuer bene anſweared, or he had neuer ſpoken of it before, when as he had it alſo <note place="margin">Pag. 60.</note> vp in his <hi>Motiues:</hi> and in his next worke not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely but we may heare newes of it againe; ſuch is his grace in writinge, and the great choiſe he hath of abundant matter.</p>
               <p>Here I am to admonishe the good reader of newes, which I receiued lately, and that is after I had written thus much, Bels reply called <hi>The Ieſuits Antepaſt</hi> came piping hoat to mine hands, from the pallace of his kitching, in defence of his <hi>Douwneſall</hi> againſt the anſwear of <hi>S. R.</hi> and therefor making no doubt but that he had at leaſt attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to batter in pieces all that <hi>S. R.</hi> had ſaid in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that oath, and ſo ſpoiled alſo the grace of that which I had brought out of him, I thought good to take a taſte: wherevpon I fell abord with <hi>his Antepaſt,</hi> opened the diſhes, and found there
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:132780:99"/> a miſerable poore pittance, all the fatte through the cookes negligence being fallen into the fire: for <hi>S. R.</hi> diſputeth for the lawefulnes thereof <note place="margin">Art. 30. chap. 14.</note> in this manner. <hi>As for the oaths of Bishops made to the the Pope, the lawfulnes thereof appeareth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is made with all Catholique Princes conſent, and meant only in iuſt and lawfull things which are according to Gods lawe, and holy Canons, and it hath bene vſed aboue a thouſand yeares agoe, as is euident by the like oath made by a Bishoppe vnto S. Gregory the great: and S. Bonifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 10. ep. 31. Baron. ann. 723. See co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cil. Tolet an. 11. can. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>the Apoſtle of Germany and worthyeſt man that euer England bredde, did ſweare when he was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Bishoppe, to concurre with the Pope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of his Church,</hi> in which words is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned that which I ſaid in defence thereof. To all which this kitchin miniſter ſaith not one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and yet in great brauery he writeth thus. <hi>Say on good frier, thou shalt be heard with all fauour.</hi> To <note place="margin">Antepast pag. 147.</note> imitate his vaine, may I not rather ſay, it is not ſo Sir Lyer, thou haſt curtald a way the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his anſweare of good moment, and very ſufficient for the iuſtification of that oath in generall: is this to be heard with fauour? not ſo, but it is with cooſenage to abuſe the good reader, which carryeth with it a ſtinking ſauour.</p>
               <p>The reſt of that which he iangleth about the oath, I leaue to <hi>S. R.</hi> yet this will I briefly ſay, that for as much I haue here readd, his anſwear ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth ſound without the loſſe of any one droppe of bloud, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the terrible Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>non ſhott of <hi>Bels Antepaſt.</hi> And the principall of that which he muſtereth together, for the refelling thereof,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:132780:99"/> is contayned in this <hi>his Triall</hi> (about which I nowe labour) in the eight chapter, where he intreateth <hi>of the Popes fayth.</hi> Let that be peruſed which I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue ſaid before in the examination of that chapter, and it will ſone appeare that it is not the buckler of <hi>his Antepaſt,</hi> that can defend our newe cooke from the wounding of his old carcas.</p>
               <p>Thus much of his eleauen chapters. Here for a concluſion, I muſt adde a word or two. The firſt is, that how truly or falſely he hath alleadged authors I knowe not, hauing peruſed the places of fewe, becauſe the ſubiect was not waighty, but only of ceremonies or matters of ſmall moment. The ſecond is, which I noted alſo before, that grauntinge authority to the Church to ordaine ceremonies, he goeth againſt his owne doctrine, in calling them rotten ragges of a newe religion, &amp; teacheth others how to entertayne thoſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which either they haue borrowed from vs, or els brought forth by a later generation. The laſt is, that where as he confeſſeth many of our ceremonies to be very auncient, as the <hi>Introit</hi> of the maſſe, which was inſtituted as he ſaith by <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine:</hi> the <hi>Pax</hi> brought in by <hi>Innocentius:</hi> and the <hi>Paſchall torch</hi> ordained by <hi>Sozimus:</hi> (all which Popes liued about ſome twelue hundred years agoe) with what face or grace, can he ſpeake ſo ſcornfully of them, calling them rotten ragges, when as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putinge againſt the Puritanicall fraternity, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Engliſh ceremonies in his booke called <hi>The Regiment of the Church,</hi> antiquity is vrged, the practiſe of the Church inculcated, &amp; with all his learning he laboureth to procure credit to their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:132780:100"/> ceremoniall lawes inſtitutions, as is euident out of all that treatiſe.</p>
               <p>And to ſpeake ſom what in particular, To proue the vſe of the Surpleſſe or albe, he alleadgeth a <note place="margin">Can. 14.</note> Canon of the fourth Councell of <hi>Carthage</hi> which he doth highly extol in this manner. <hi>At this Councel</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment. cap. 8. pag. 82.</note> (quoth he) <hi>were preſent two hundred and fourtene Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes, of which S. Augustin was one, and yet all thoſe holy men, liuing in thoſe dayes when no corruption of religion had crept into the Church, affirme constantly, &amp;c.</hi> Behould good reader ther chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gable conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this Chame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leon: The Albe or Surpleſſe is a commendable ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, and reuerent rite, becauſe it was allowed in the tyme of <hi>S. Augustin,</hi> when no corruption had crept into the Churche: but the Introite in the maſſe: the <hi>Pax:</hi> the <hi>Paſchall torche,</hi> inſtituted by thoſe Popes in <hi>S. Auguſtinus</hi> tyme, are rotten ragges, and intreated in all ſcornfull manner, though no other difference can be founde but only the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters pleaſure, hauinge one doctrine and other principles to followe, when he diſputeth againſt vs, and an other, when he argueth againſt the <note place="margin">See his Regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the Preface.</note> Puritanes, whom he calleth. <hi>Curſed broodes, vntimely hatched, deteſted of God, and irksome to the world.</hi> God open the eies of good people, to take heede howe they followe the ianglinge of ſuch a Bell, that can clincke what religion youe thinke, and committe their ſoules to the direction of ſuche a mutable miniſter.</p>
               <p>I omitte here, howe before he would haue the Church ſtraight after <hi>S. Iohns</hi> tyme to haue bene <note place="margin">Bel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth himſelfe.</note> infected with errors, becauſe that ſerued him well againſt vs in that place: here the Church was in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:132780:100"/> 
                  <hi>S. Auguſtins</hi> tyme, cleare from all corruption in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which was three hundred yeares after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſtandeth him here in great ſtead againſt <hi>the</hi> Puritanes: for it were an infinite labour to purſue him in all his trickes, quirckes corruptions, contrarieties, and abſurdities, himſelf ſaying that in one place, which he vnſaith in an other: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge that here, which els where he diſproueth: ſailing with that winde which bloweth, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his commoditie of that which may help the preſent neceſsity. Such be the conditions of the reformed miniſter truſty Sir Thomas.</p>

He pretended to proue out of the Councell of <hi>Conſtance</hi> that the ſuperiority of the Pope, was neuer knowne tille that tyme: and he proueth the cleane contrary. <hi>The Councel defined</hi> (quoth he) <hi>that a Councell is aboue the Pope.</hi> What is this to the ſuperiority of the Pope aboue a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell which he vndertoke to iuſtifie out of the

The firſt is, that the doctrine of the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority aboue a Councell is no older then the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, for that ſence his words doe plainly inſinuate. The ſecond is, that none teach it but the Ieſuits &amp; their Ieſuited crewe, as he ſpeaketh, both which ſhall be conuiuced with one and the ſelf ſame teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Not to ſpeake therefore of many learned men, that either be nowe liuinge, or wrot ſince the name of Ieſuits was of any fame in Chriſtendom, for all theſe will be turned ouer for birds of that feather: I will name only thoſe which ſhall hould the miniſters noſe to the grind-ſtone.

                  <p>To theſe learned men, I will adde the teſtimony
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:132780:104"/> of the <hi>Lateran Councell</hi> vnder <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, which <note place="margin">This Councel was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the yeare. 1513.

Only one remayneth which I wil adde, more potent then the former, eſpecially in reſpect of Bell, and that is of himſelf, who when he ſaith that <hi>this doctrine was not knowen to the Church of God</hi> vntill the tyme of the Councell of <hi>Constance.</hi> graunteth that then it began at leaſt to be taught, and ſo neither proceeded from Ieſuits or Ieſuited perſons, as being of longer ſtanding by his owne graunte, Falſe alſo it is, that this doctrine was not knowen to the Church before the tyme of the Councel of <hi>Conſtance.</hi> The glorious Martyr, our <note place="margin">Diſt. 40. cap.
